# Prism-Customer-Segmentation
## Objective
To help the marketing team of an e-commerce company drive up conversion rates through customer segmentation. To split customers into customer segments through RFM analysis and provide insights and recommendations to improve their conversion rate. Data cleaning and exploration to be done in BigQuery (SQL) and data visualisation in PowerBI.

## Analysis
Different customer groups require different approaches to improve engagement. Defined customer groups as:
1. Champion
2. Loyal
3. Whale
4. New
5. At Risk
6. Lost
Champions spent the most and had the highest average transaction count. Our most valuable customers. For Champions, those with the loyalty shceme had a higher transaction count compared to those without. Recommendation to send exclusive offers to persuade non-loyalty members to join. This would solidify high-revenue customer loyalty.

Our lost customers are increasing year-on-year. Recommendation to plan re-engagement emails offering discounts, aiming to bring back 15% of lost customers.

However, despite all of this less than 15% of customers can be contacted via marketing due to most customers opting out of email communication. To combat this, offer discounts based on opting in to email marketing. The impact of this is that getting 10% of at-risk users to opt-in could lead to 6,000 re-engagement contacts.
